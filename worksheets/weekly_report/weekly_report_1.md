# Weekly Report

This report is for you to document the progres of your project. You should also document any change in plan, e.g. change in design or change in API specification or change in work allocation. The following is a template for you to follow.

## What have I done last week

- Configured the Basic Setup of Our Express App (Installing modules required and also a simple DB setup)
- Implemented a Reset Table Function and created a simple POST request API to add in data.

## What do I plan to do next week

- Continue to complete the backend development (query data and result)
- Work on the Result API and figure out how to implement the knapsack algorithm into the code.

## Additional Thoughts

-   VSCode is sick.
-   This addon is fabulous.
